#What's the way to create patches

= Introduction =
If you are a non member and want contribute something, you need simply start a new issue and attach a patch file with your own changes to it.

The best way to create the patch are the following steps:

<code language="bash">
# check out the vopenlayers project and do your changes
# ... if you are finished ...
# 1. switch to the root of your project
cd vopenlayers-read-only
# 2. update your working copy
svn update
# 3. create the patch file
svn diff > myPatch.diff
